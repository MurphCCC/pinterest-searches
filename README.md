Search terms used on Pinterest scraped from an unofficial api

I recently came across an endpoint on s.pinimg.com that exposes lists of keywords along with a score.  As best I can figure these are queries that are used on their site and assigned a score based on how often they are used.  That's just a shot in the dark though.  The lists are broken up into male and female.  Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated.

# Endpoints

Here are the endpoints I used to scrape this data

## https://s.pinimg.com/client_cache/us/en/male/epoch=2018-08-06-00-00/engagement/base/part-00000
## through
## https://s.pinimg.com/client_cache/us/en/male/epoch=2018-08-06-00-00/engagement/base/part-00004

The female list was generated by changing male to female.
